## Abstract:

**Background:** Cortical GABAergic neuron dysregulation is implicated in schizophrenia (SCZ), but it remains unclear whether these changes are due to altered cell proportions or per-cell changes in mRNA expression.  

**Methods:** We analyzed 14 bulk and cell type-specific RNAseq datasets from 1,408 individuals (672 SCZ cases, 736 controls) across three neocortical regions. We deconvolved GABAergic cell subtype proportions from bulk RNA-seq and benchmarked them against single-nucleus RNAseq and stereological densities from matched donors. We assessed SCZ- and age-associated changes in cell proportions and per-cell gene expression.  

**Results:** SCZ was associated with altered proportions of neocortical parvalbumin (PVALB) and somatostatin (SST) cells, dependent on the subject's age at death. Younger SCZ cases (age < 70 years) showed reduced PVALB and SST cell proportions, while older cases showed unchanged or increased proportions compared to controls. Earlier onset SCZ, associated with more severe clinical symptoms, was linked to greater reductions in these cell types. Additionally, there was robust evidence for reduced per-cell SST and VIP mRNA among younger cases with SCZ.  

**Conclusions:** These findings suggest that SCZ is associated with complex, age-dependent alterations in GABAergic neurons, particularly affecting PVALB and SST cells. Our study underscores the importance of age-stratified analyses in SCZ, suggesting that distinct pathological processes underlie GABAergic neuron dysregulation across differ
